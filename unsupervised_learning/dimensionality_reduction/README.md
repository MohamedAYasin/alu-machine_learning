# Dimensionality Reduction

## Description:

This technique allows me to simplify the feature space without losing significant information, making it easier to visualize, analyze, and model the data. Whether I'm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for linear transformations or t-SNE for capturing non-linear complexities, dimensionality reduction has been invaluable for optimizing computational efficiency and improving model performance.
