### Learning Objectives

- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

###### General
1. What is the ML Life Cycle?
2. What are the challenges of implementing the ML Life Cycle?
3. How to use Databricks and MLFlow to deploy an ML Model

## Tasks

### Project Requirements:

~ Create a student Databricks account and sign up for their community version. Then, develop your own ML project using Databricks and MLFlow:

- Pick any of the models that we have built over the course of this specialization and implement it in Databricks
- Create a new MLFlow experiment
- Create a new cluster
- Add your data
- When your ML model is ran, it should keep track of the relevant parameters and metrics
- Your model should be packaged into an MLflow Model
- When done, please include screen shots of the results of your training and logging with Databricks below.

## Things I did:

- Signed up for a databricks account with a community version.
- Created a new MLflow experiment called `Diabetes`
- Created a new cluster called `mlflow`
- Added a Notebook with ML model that is building a Random Forest Regressor for predicting diabetes progression
- The model is tracking relevant parameters and metrics
- The model is also packaged and published into an MLflow Model
- Added screenshots of my model hosted on the databricks platform/website.
