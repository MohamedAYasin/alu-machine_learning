# NLP Metrics

## Description:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) metrics are tools used to evaluate the performance and accuracy of NLP models and algorithms. These metrics assess various aspects of language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and more. Common NLP metrics include BLEU for translation quality, ROUGE for summarization effectiveness, and perplexity for language model evaluation. These metrics help in quantitatively measuring how well an NLP model performs compared to human standards or reference data, providing crucial feedback for model improvement and validation.
