# Trandsformer Applications

## Description:

Transformers are a type of deep learning model that have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Their unique architecture, which relies on attention mechanisms, allows them to efficiently process and interpret large sequences of data, like text, without the limitations of older models like RNNs and LSTMs. This makes them exceptionally good at tasks like language translation, text summarization, and question-answering. They're known for their speed and accuracy, making them the go-to choice for many advanced NLP applications.
